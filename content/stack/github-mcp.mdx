The official [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) connects your AI agent to the full GitHub API surface — maintained by GitHub themselves. This is one of the most broadly adopted MCP servers because nearly every developer workflow touches GitHub at some point.

What you can do:

- **Issues** — create, label, assign, close, and search across repos
- **Pull requests** — open, review, merge, and summarize diffs
- **Code search** — find functions, patterns, or references across your codebase
- **File operations** — read, create, and update files directly
- **Branch management** — create, delete, and compare branches

### Setup

1. Generate a **Personal Access Token** from **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens**
2. Grant the scopes you need — `repo` for private repos, `read:org` for organization data
3. Add the server to your MCP config with the `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable

Fine-grained tokens are recommended if you want to limit access to specific repositories.

### Example prompts

> "Open a PR from my current branch to main with a summary of all commits."

> "Find all open issues labeled 'good first issue' in the frontend repo."

> "Review the latest PR on acme/api-service — flag any changes to authentication logic."

> "Read the README in our docs repo and update the installation section."

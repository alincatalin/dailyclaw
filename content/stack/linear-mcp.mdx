The [Linear MCP Server](https://linear.app/docs/mcp) is Linear's official MCP integration. It provides a centrally hosted, authenticated server that gives any compatible AI agent direct access to your Linear workspace. Instead of switching between your editor and Linear's UI, you can manage your entire project workflow through conversation. Works especially well for triaging bugs mid-coding session — describe the problem, assign it, set priority, and move on without breaking flow.

Two transport options:

- **HTTP (recommended)** — connects to Linear's hosted endpoint at `mcp.linear.app/mcp`. More reliable and broadly supported.
- **SSE** — Server-Sent Events transport at `mcp.linear.app/sse`. Useful as a fallback for WSL users on Windows.

What you can do:

- **Issues** — discover, create, update, assign, prioritize, and close
- **Projects & cycles** — query backlogs, manage sprints, track progress
- **Comments** — add, read, and reference comments on any issue
- **Team data** — look up members, assignments, and workload distribution

### Setup — Claude Code

The simplest path. One command, then authenticate through your browser.

1. Run `claude mcp add --transport http linear-server https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`
2. Start a new Claude Code instance
3. Use `/mcp` → select linear-server → Authenticate through browser

### Setup — Cursor

One-click installation available through the MCP tools directory.

1. Open Cursor's MCP tools directory
2. Find Linear and click Install
3. Authorize access through browser

### Setup — VS Code

Uses `npx mcp-remote` to proxy the remote server.

1. Open command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → "MCP: Open User Configuration"
2. Add the Linear server config:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "linear": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Click Start and authorize access

### Setup — Windsurf

Same approach as VS Code — configure in settings JSON.

1. Open Windsurf MCP configuration
2. Add the Linear server:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "linear": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/sse"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Authorize access through browser

### Setup — Zed

Configured as a custom context server.

1. Open Zed settings
2. Add Linear as a context server using `npx mcp-remote https://mcp.linear.app/sse`
3. Authorize access through browser

### Example prompts

> "Create a high-priority bug for the payments team: checkout fails when applying two discount codes."

> "Show me all in-progress issues assigned to me in the current cycle."

> "Move all issues labeled 'needs-triage' in Project Atlas to the backlog and add a comment."

> "Summarize what the frontend team shipped this cycle and list any issues that slipped."

### Tips for better results

Use specific language when referencing Linear objects — include team names, project names, and label names so the agent resolves them correctly. For batch operations, be explicit about scope (e.g. "all issues in Project X labeled 'bug'") to avoid unintended changes. If you hit authentication errors, clear the cache with `rm -rf ~/.mcp-auth` and re-authenticate.

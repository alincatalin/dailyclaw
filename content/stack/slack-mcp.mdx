The Slack MCP Server lets your AI agent read and write messages in your Slack workspace. Useful for cross-referencing channel discussions with your code, notifying your team about deployments, or catching up on conversations you missed.

What you can do:

- **Read channels** — pull recent messages, catch up on discussions
- **Post messages** — send updates, announcements, and status reports
- **Thread management** — reply in context, keep conversations organized
- **Search** — find specific messages, topics, or mentions across your workspace

### Setup

1. Create a Slack app at **api.slack.com/apps**
2. Add Bot Token scopes: `channels:read`, `channels:history`, `chat:write`, `users:read`
3. Install the app to your workspace and copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**
4. Add the server to your MCP config with the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
5. Run `npx @anthropic/mcp-server-slack` to test

**Note:** Cursor and Windsurf support is limited — verify functionality on those clients.

### Example prompts

> "Read the last 20 messages in #engineering-incidents and summarize the database outage."

> "Post to #deployments: 'v2.4.1 shipped — includes the cart fix and rate limiter update.'"

> "Find the thread in #backend about Redis caching and reply with the approach from our code review."

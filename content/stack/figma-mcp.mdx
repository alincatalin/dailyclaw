The [Figma MCP Server](https://developers.figma.com/docs/figma-mcp-server/) is Figma's official integration for AI coding agents. It connects your IDE directly to your Figma files — select a frame, ask your agent to build it, and get code that actually matches the design. No more eyeballing spacing or copying hex values.

Two connection methods:

- **Remote server** — connects to Figma's hosted endpoint at `mcp.figma.com`, no desktop app required. Uses OAuth authentication.
- **Desktop server** — runs locally through the Figma desktop app at `127.0.0.1:3845`. Supports selection-based prompting (select a frame in Figma, then ask your agent).

What you can do:

- **Generate code from frames** — select a Figma frame and turn it into production code
- **Extract design context** — pull variables, components, and layout data into your IDE
- **Code Connect** — leverage your actual design system components so generated code stays consistent with your codebase
- **Retrieve Make resources** — access code resources from Make files as context during development

### Setup — Remote server

The remote server is the simplest path. No Figma desktop app needed.

**Claude Code:**
1. Run `claude mcp add --transport http figma https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
2. Start a new Claude Code instance
3. Use `/mcp` → select figma → Authenticate through browser

**Cursor:**
1. Click the Figma MCP server deep link from the docs
2. Click Install → Connect → Open
3. Allow access through browser

**VS Code:**
1. Open command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → "MCP: Open User Configuration"
2. Add the Figma server config pointing to `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
3. Click Start and authorize access

### Setup — Desktop server

Requires the Figma desktop app. Gives you selection-based prompting — select a frame in Figma, then ask your agent about it.

1. Open a Design file in Figma desktop → switch to **Dev Mode** (Shift+D)
2. In the Inspect panel, click **"Enable desktop MCP server"**
3. The server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`
4. Add it to your editor — e.g. `claude mcp add --transport http figma-desktop http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp`

### Example prompts

> "Select this frame and generate a React component with Tailwind classes that matches the design."

> "Extract all color tokens, font sizes, and spacing values as CSS custom properties."

> "Use my Code Connect components to build out this new feature flow from the Figma designs."

> "Compare the button styles in our Figma file against our current button component and list every discrepancy."

### Tips for better output

Structure your Figma files for cleaner results — use auto-layout, name your layers clearly, and avoid massive heavy frames. Writing specific prompts helps too: tell the agent which framework, styling approach, and component patterns to follow.

[GOG](https://gogcli.sh/) unifies Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Contacts, Tasks, Sheets, Docs, and Slides under one CLI — with JSON output and sane defaults. Instead of juggling separate APIs and SDKs, you get a single `gog` command that covers the full Google Workspace surface. Pairs especially well with AI agents: pipe JSON output into your agent's context, or use the Gmail Pub/Sub watch daemon to trigger workflows on incoming email.

Two install options:

- **Homebrew (recommended)** — `brew install steipete/tap/gogcli`. One command, ready to go.
- **From source** — clone the [repo](https://github.com/steipete/gogcli), run `make`, and use `./bin/gog`.

What you can do:

- **Gmail** — search, send, manage labels, create drafts, set up filters, configure settings, and run Pub/Sub watch for push notifications
- **Calendar** — list, create, and update events, RSVP, detect conflicts, check free/busy
- **Drive** — list, search, upload, download, manage permissions and folders, export to PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX/CSV
- **Sheets / Docs / Slides** — read and write content with format export
- **Contacts & People** — personal contacts, workspace directory, profile lookups
- **Tasks** — manage tasklists with add, update, done, and delete operations

### Setup — Authentication

1. Download your Google Cloud OAuth credentials (Desktop app type):
   ```bash
   gog auth credentials ~/Downloads/client_secret_....json
   ```
2. Add an account (opens browser for OAuth consent):
   ```bash
   gog auth add you@gmail.com
   ```
3. Set your default account:
   ```bash
   export GOG_ACCOUNT=you@gmail.com
   ```

Credentials are stored in your OS keyring (Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on Linux, CredMan on Windows). Use `gog auth manage` to switch between multiple accounts.

### Setup — Gmail Pub/Sub with OpenClaw

GOG's `gmail watch serve` daemon connects Gmail push notifications to [OpenClaw webhooks](https://docs.openclaw.ai/automation/gmail-pubsub), enabling real-time email processing and delivery to chat surfaces.

**How it works:** Gmail watch detects new messages → publishes to Pub/Sub topic → `gog gmail watch serve` daemon receives push → forwards to OpenClaw webhook → processes email and delivers summary.

**Quick setup (recommended):**
```bash
openclaw webhooks gmail setup --account openclaw@gmail.com
```

This installs dependencies, configures Tailscale Funnel for HTTPS tunneling, and enables the Gmail hook preset automatically.

**Manual setup:**
1. Configure your GCP project and enable Gmail + Pub/Sub APIs:
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable gmail.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com
   ```
2. Create the Pub/Sub topic:
   ```bash
   gcloud pubsub topics create gog-gmail-watch
   ```
3. Grant Gmail API publish permissions to the topic
4. Run the daemon:
   ```bash
   gog gmail watch serve --account you@gmail.com \
     --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8788 --path /gmail-pubsub \
     --hook-url <openclaw-endpoint>
   ```

Or use the automated runner: `openclaw webhooks gmail run`

### Example usage

```bash
# Search Gmail
gog gmail search "from:sarah subject:roadmap" --max 5

# Send an email
gog gmail send --to team@company.com --subject "Standup notes" --body "..."

# List today's calendar events
gog calendar list --from today --to tomorrow

# Upload a file to Drive
gog drive upload ./report.pdf --folder "Shared Reports"

# Read a Google Sheet as JSON
gog sheets get <sheet-id> --format json

# Check Gmail watch status
gog gmail watch status --account you@gmail.com
```

### Example agent prompts

> "Search my inbox for all unread emails from the last 24 hours and summarize each one."

> "Draft a reply to Sarah's email about the Q3 roadmap — acknowledge her timeline concerns and suggest a sync next Tuesday."

> "Check my calendar for conflicts next week and list all double-booked slots."

> "Find all files in my Drive folder 'Client Proposals' and list them with their last modified dates."

### Tips for better results

Use `--format json` when piping output to agents — it gives structured data instead of table formatting. For multi-account setups, set `GOG_ACCOUNT` per session or use `gog auth manage` to switch. The Gmail Pub/Sub watch auto-renews, but check status with `gog gmail watch status` if notifications stop. Gmail hook content in OpenClaw is wrapped with safety boundaries by default to prevent injection attacks via email content.

The Stripe MCP Server lets your agent interact with your Stripe account directly. Particularly valuable for founders and small teams who handle billing support themselves — look up a customer, check payment history, issue a refund, or generate an invoice without opening the dashboard.

What you can do:

- **Customer lookup** — find customers by email, ID, or subscription status
- **Payment monitoring** — check recent charges, failed payments, and disputes
- **Subscription management** — view, update, or cancel subscriptions
- **Invoices & refunds** — generate invoices, process refunds, handle disputes
- **Revenue reporting** — MRR, churn, and payment trends through natural language

### Setup

1. Grab your API key from **Developers > API keys** in the Stripe dashboard
2. Use a **restricted key** with only the permissions you need — not your secret key
3. Add the server to your MCP config with the `STRIPE_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Run `npx @stripe/mcp-server` to test the connection

Start with **test mode keys** first to verify everything works before pointing it at live data.

### Example prompts

> "Look up the customer with email jane@acme.com and show me their last 5 payments."

> "How many subscriptions churned in the last 30 days, and what was the total MRR lost?"

> "Customer cus_abc123 says they were double-charged — check their invoices and process a refund if there's a duplicate."

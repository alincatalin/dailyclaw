The [Brave Search MCP Server](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server) gives your AI agent live access to the web. Whenever your agent needs current information — recent library releases, API documentation, error messages, or local business details — it searches Brave and returns real results instead of guessing.

It exposes six dedicated tools:

- **Web search** — full-featured search with filtering and spellcheck
- **Local search** — business and place discovery with ratings
- **Video search** — video results with metadata and thumbnails
- **Image search** — image discovery with automatic fetching
- **News search** — current articles with freshness controls
- **AI summarizer** — condense search results into a concise answer

This eliminates a whole class of hallucinations around version numbers, API changes, and recent events.

### Setup

1. Grab an API key from **brave.com/search/api** — the free tier gives you 2,000 queries/month
2. Add the server to your MCP config and set the `BRAVE_API_KEY` environment variable
3. Install with `npx -y @brave/brave-search-mcp-server`, or use Docker via `mcp/brave-search`

The default transport is STDIO. Switch to HTTP with `BRAVE_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` if needed. You can also control which tools are exposed using `BRAVE_MCP_ENABLED_TOOLS` or `BRAVE_MCP_DISABLED_TOOLS` to limit the surface area.

### Example prompts

> "Search for the latest release notes for Next.js 15 and summarize breaking changes."

> "Find local coffee shops near me with ratings above 4.5."

> "Search for this error: 'ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432' and tell me the most common fixes."

The news tool is particularly useful for time-sensitive queries, and the summarizer saves you from reading through ten links to get a straight answer.

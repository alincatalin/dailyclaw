The [Obsidian MCP Server](https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server) bridges AI agents to your Obsidian vault through the Local REST API plugin. It turns your vault into a queryable, writable knowledge base — a natural fit for anyone using Obsidian as a personal wiki, research repository, or daily journal. The agent pulls context from your existing notes to give more grounded, personalized answers.

Two connection options:

- **HTTP (recommended)** — non-encrypted local server, typically at `http://127.0.0.1:27123`. Simplest setup.
- **HTTPS** — encrypted endpoint at `https://127.0.0.1:27124` with a self-signed certificate. Requires `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=false`.

What you can do:

- **Read notes** — retrieve content and metadata in markdown or JSON format
- **Search vault** — full-text and regex search across the entire vault with pagination and path filtering
- **Create & update** — write new notes or modify existing ones via append, prepend, or overwrite
- **Search & replace** — find-and-replace within a specific note using text or regex
- **Frontmatter** — get, set, or delete YAML frontmatter keys atomically
- **Tags** — add, remove, or retrieve tags from notes (frontmatter and inline)
- **List directories** — browse files and subdirectories with filtering by extension or name
- **Delete notes** — permanently remove files from the vault

### Prerequisites

1. **Obsidian** installed with a vault open
2. **Local REST API plugin** enabled — go to **Settings > Community plugins**, search "Local REST API", install and enable it
3. **API key** — generated in the plugin settings (copy it for the next step)
4. **Node.js v18+** with npm

### Setup — Claude Code

1. Run:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add obsidian-server -e OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY -e OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:27123 -- npx obsidian-mcp-server
   ```
2. Start a new Claude Code instance
3. Use `/mcp` to verify the server is connected

### Setup — Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["obsidian-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY",
        "OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:27123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup — Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf

Add to your MCP configuration (`.mcp.json` or editor settings):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "obsidian": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["obsidian-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "YOUR_KEY",
        "OBSIDIAN_BASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:27123"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example prompts

> "Search my vault for everything I've written about microservices architecture and summarize it."

> "Create a new note in Projects titled 'CLI Rewrite Plan' with sections for goals, timeline, and open questions."

> "Read today's daily note and pull out all action items into a bullet list."

> "Find all notes tagged #product-ideas and identify common themes across them."

### Tips for better results

Keep your vault organized with clear folder structures and consistent tagging — the agent's search results improve dramatically with well-named notes and meaningful frontmatter. For large vaults, the built-in cache (enabled by default, refreshes every 10 minutes) keeps operations fast. If you're on HTTPS, set `OBSIDIAN_VERIFY_SSL=false` to avoid self-signed certificate errors.

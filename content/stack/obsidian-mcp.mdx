The Obsidian MCP Server turns your Obsidian vault into a queryable, writable knowledge base for your AI agent. Instead of manually searching through hundreds of notes, you can ask your agent to find relevant information, cross-reference topics, and even create or update notes on your behalf. It is a natural fit for anyone who uses Obsidian as a personal wiki, research repository, or daily journal — the agent can pull context from your existing notes to give more grounded, personalized answers.

To set up, you need the Obsidian Local REST API plugin installed and enabled in your vault. Open Obsidian, go to **Settings > Community plugins**, search for "Local REST API," and install it. Once enabled, it will expose your vault on a local port (default 27124) with an API key for authentication. Add the server to your MCP config with the `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` and `OBSIDIAN_API_URL` environment variables. Run `npx obsidian-mcp` and confirm it can list your vault files.

Prompts that get real use: "Search my vault for everything I've written about microservices architecture and give me a summary." Or "Create a new note in my Projects folder titled 'CLI Rewrite Plan' with sections for goals, timeline, and open questions." For daily workflows: "Read today's daily note and pull out all action items into a bullet list." You can also use it for research synthesis: "Find all notes tagged #product-ideas from the last 3 months and identify the three most common themes." The read-write access means your agent can both consume and contribute to your knowledge base.

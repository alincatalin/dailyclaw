The PostgreSQL MCP Server gives your AI agent direct access to your Postgres databases. Invaluable during development — instead of switching to a SQL client, ask your agent and get the answer inline. Runs read queries by default, so you can explore data without worrying about accidental mutations.

What you can do:

- **Schema inspection** — list tables, describe columns, indexes, and foreign keys
- **Run queries** — natural language to SQL, results in a readable format
- **Index analysis** — identify missing indexes and optimization opportunities
- **Data export** — pull query results for debugging or reporting

### Setup

1. Prepare a connection string: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`
2. Add the server to your MCP config with the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable
3. Run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres` to verify

For production databases, use a **read-only connection string** to enforce safe access at the database level.

### Example prompts

> "Show me the schema for the users and orders tables, including indexes and foreign keys."

> "How many orders were placed in the last 7 days, grouped by status?"

> "Compare the current schema of the payments table with this migration file — anything missing?"

> "Find all users who signed up in the last 24 hours but have zero orders."

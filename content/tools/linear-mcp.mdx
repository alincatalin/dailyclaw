The Linear MCP Server gives your AI agent direct access to your Linear workspace. Instead of switching between your editor and Linear's UI, you can create issues, update statuses, query backlogs, and manage cycles entirely through conversation. It works especially well for triaging bugs mid-coding session — describe the problem, assign it to the right team, set priority, and move on without breaking flow.

To get started, generate a Linear API key from your workspace settings under **Settings > API > Personal API Keys**. Copy the key and add the server to your MCP config file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json` or `.mcp.json` depending on your client). Set the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable in the server configuration. Run `npx @linear/mcp-server` to verify the connection, and you should see your workspace data come through immediately.

Here are prompts that work well in practice: "Create a high-priority bug for the payments team: checkout fails when applying two discount codes at once." Or "Show me all in-progress issues assigned to me in the current cycle." You can also batch operations: "Move all issues labeled 'needs-triage' in Project Atlas to the backlog and add a comment saying we'll revisit next sprint." The server handles reads and writes, so you can go from investigation to action without leaving your agent.
